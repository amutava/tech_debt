Polymorphism:
Inheritance:
Encapsulation:
instances
instance variables ---any value instantiated by self
instance methods ---has instance as one of its parameters(self)
constructor the init method. initializes all the data for the object
self --- points to the object being created
class --- a blueprint
class vaiable --- Variable that all the objects have access to

Every class comes with pre-existing class variables:
-  __doc__ : gives a documentation of the class
- __name__ : The functionâ€™s name
- __module__ :The name of the module the function was defined in, or None if unavailable.
